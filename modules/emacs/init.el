;;; Commentary:

;; Packages in this Emacs configuration are derived from
;; Nix.  `used-packages.el' introspects this file and extracts
;; Nix packages from the `use-package' statements.
;;
;; Most dependencies are on MELPA.  Those that aren't appear in the
;; overlay in default.nix.
;;
;; If you like what you see, copy, as I have done from others.  If you
;; see room for improvement, pull requests are welcome.  This is my
;; personal config, and I might not merge it, but I always enjoy a
;; good editor discussion.
