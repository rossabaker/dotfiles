;;; Commentary:

;; Packages in this Emacs configuration are derived from
;; Nix. `used-packages.el' introspects this file and extracts
;; Nix packages from the `use-package' statements.
;;
;; Most dependencies are on MELPA.  Those that aren't appear in the
;; overlay in default.nix.
;;
;; If you like what you see, copy, as I have done from others.  If you
;; see room for improvement, pull requests are welcome.  This is my
;; personal config, and I might not merge it, but I always enjoy a
;; good editor discussion.

;;; Code:

;;;; use-package

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))

;;;; Basic human decency

;; I am a Chicago Bears fan.  They're still my team in the 2020s, even
;; if they make me think of 1985.  In that sense, they're like Emacs'
;; defaults.
(use-package better-defaults)

;;;; Version control

(use-package magit
  :bind
  ("C-c g s" . magit-status))

;;;; Fin.

(provide 'init)

;;; init.el ends here
